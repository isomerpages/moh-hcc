The Singapore Healthcare Corps (SHC) was launched by the Ministry of Health on 7 April 2020 to build a reserve pool of healthcare professionals to augment our healthcare manpower in our national response to tackling the COVID-19 outbreak. Today, SHC serves as an auxiliary arm of our healthcare manpower during both crisis and peace time. We aim to build up a volunteer corps of healthcare professionals and laypersons who are keen to contribute to the healthcare services during peace time and support outbreak operations.
