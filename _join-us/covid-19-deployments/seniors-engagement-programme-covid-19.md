**Description**

We are looking for Doctors with a valid practising certificate with the Singapore Medical Council to volunteer for the Seniors Engagement Programme (SEP) where Doctors will do house visits to the homes of selected elderly and address their concerns regarding the COVID-19 vaccinations. Doctors will only be required to engage the elderly together with the regular volunteers in that community, and do not need to administer any vaccinations for the elderly. Doctors can choose to contribute in any of the deployment locations islandwide.

If you are interested, please sign up in the form below.
