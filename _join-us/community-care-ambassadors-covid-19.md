**Description**

Community care is a pivotal part of our healthcare system and covers a range of care settings such as nursing homes, senior care centres, community hospitals, and hospices. Seniors cared for in the community will require more support especially amidst COVID-19, and you can play a part in their care. With training, individuals with or without healthcare experience can support care of our seniors by being a Community Care Ambassador.

**Training and Commitment**

Training will be provided to prepare you for work and volunteer roles at community care organisations. These include e-learning and in-person modules in:
* Basic care - supporting seniors in activities of daily living, and monitoring of vital signs
* Mobility assistance - techniques in lifting and transferring seniors, falls prevention
* Communication and Engagement - engaging seniors in social and recreational activities

Training is fully funded by the SG Healthcare Corps and will be conducted through our training partners. Interested individuals should be able to commit to the full training duration of 5 days (or 3 days for former nurses).
