#### 1. Who can join the SG Healthcare Corps?
We welcome people from all backgrounds to join us to serve at public healthcare institutions, community care facilities, and more. Training, if applicable, will be funded and will be conducted through our training partners. Please note that you must be aged 18 years old and above to be considered for roles.

#### 2. Can I still sign up if I am currently employed in another (healthcare) organisation? Should I inform my current employer that I have signed up for SG Healthcare Corps? 
You are still welcome to sign up. You should concurrently inform your current employer that you have signed up for SG Healthcare Corps. If an available match is identified for you, you will receive more information regarding the assignment for your further review. Before you agree to any deployment, you should inform your employer beforehand and comply with MOH’s and your employer’s guidelines, if any.

#### 3. I have signed up via the Volunteer Registration Form. What's next?
Thank you for your interest in joining the SG Healthcare Corps! We will be in touch with you via email or phone call to confirm your registration with the Corps. We will then contact you of any suitable onboarding, training, and/or matched institution(s) that can benefit from your help. Stay tuned!

#### 4. How and where will I serve, if I am activated?
You will be invited to sign up for deployment opportunities that have a good match with your healthcare background and expertise. Sites where opportunities may arise include public healthcare, community care, and primary care institutions. You will support our healthcare workforce in delivering care and assurance to patients in need.

#### 5. I submitted my application, but I wish to change some details. What should I do?
If there are changes to your plans or profile, please inform us by submitting a request at [go.gov.sg/shc-change](go.gov.sg/shc-change) using the same name, email address and contact number that was used in the original form. 

#### 6. I have medical condition(s) that may complicate my deployment. What should I do?
Please keep us informed via email. This will be taken into consideration when activating you for training and/or deployment. You may let us know if you would like to be contacted if other suitable opportunity arises, or if you wish to withdraw your participation from the SG Healthcare Corps. If you are contacted by HR, please keep them informed of your medical conditions, and they should be able to advise you accordingly.
