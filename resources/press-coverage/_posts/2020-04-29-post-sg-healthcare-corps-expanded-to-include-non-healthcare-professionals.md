Launched earlier this month, the SG Healthcare Corps calls upon former and current healthcare professionals to be on standby to support healthcare workers in the fight against Covid-19.

The Ministry of Health's director of medical services, Kenneth Mak, said at a press briefing yesterday: "In addition to providing additional bed capacity and making sure we properly equip them, there was also a need to raise additional manpower to support all the expanded healthcare facilities we have created and provided."

Professor Mak said training will be provided for volunteers so that they can take on their roles competently. Some of the roles include being part of swab testing teams that support the medical teams in dormitories.

For non-healthcare workers, they may be tasked to do back-end, administrative and support roles to allow healthcare professionals doing those jobs to be redeployed on the front line.
