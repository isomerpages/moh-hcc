The MOH is looking into redeploying healthcare workers to give out Covid-19 vaccines, The Business Times (BT) has learnt.

Vaccinations in Singapore are mainly administered by nurses. Still, an MOH spokesperson told BT that “we will explore the need to train and deploy other healthcare staff” into these roles as the inoculation exercise scales up.

The ministry could also tap its SG Healthcare Corps to help with vaccination operations if needed, she added.

Said the MOH spokesperson: “We will ensure the necessary training and supervision of all staff involved in the vaccination exercise so that we can continue to maintain the highest standard of patient safety.”
