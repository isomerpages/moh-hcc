People from "all walks of life" are being asked to volunteer for Singapore's healthcare system in combating Covid-19, in response to the growing need for additional manpower.

DMS Kenneth Mak said that around 3,000 healthcare professionals have signed up to join the SG Healthcare Corps since it was launched on Apr. 7. This includes former healthcare professionals who pursued a second career outside of healthcare, and who have now come back to take on their previous roles. It also includes some who have come back out of retirement, as well as those from the private sector.
