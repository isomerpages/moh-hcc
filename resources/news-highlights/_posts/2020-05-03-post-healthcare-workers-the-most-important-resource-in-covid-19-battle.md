Healthcare workers are the most important resource in the country's fight against Covid-19, said Health Minister Gan Kim Yong, who paid tribute to them over the Labour Day weekend.

Singapore has also beefed up manpower by mobilising "the entire healthcare workforce and beyond - whether public or private, in-service healthcare workers or volunteers" through the SG Healthcare Corps launched last month, he added.

"Our battle with Covid-19 is likely to be a long journey, and I am glad that Singaporeans have rallied to support our healthcare professionals," said Mr Gan.
