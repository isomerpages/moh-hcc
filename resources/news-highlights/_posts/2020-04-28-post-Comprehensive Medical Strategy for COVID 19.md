*This press release was first published by the Ministry of Health, Singapore on April 28, 2020.*

**Augmenting our Healthcare Workforce**

The Ministry of Health (MOH) has sought the support of healthcare professionals in the private sector, and encouraged them to join the newly launched SG Healthcare Corps. Since its launch on 7 April, about 3,000 healthcare professionals across all job groups have signed up. MOH will be expanding the SG Healthcare Corps to include more healthcare professionals, as well as non-healthcare professionals. We are also re-deploying manpower from industries affected by COVID-19 to enable them to take on new roles in our hospitals. For example, Singapore Airlines (SIA) cabin crew are filling the role of care ambassadors. They provide administrative support and attend to patients, under the supervision of nursing staff.
