**Redesigning healthcare jobs and training pathways**

COVID-19 has shown us the importance of maintaining a resilient core of healthcare workers. Following the launch of the SG Healthcare Corps (SHC) in April last year, over 5,000 workers and volunteers have been trained, and provided support in areas such as the care of elderly in nursing homes, swab operations, laboratory testing and vaccination operations.

Going forward, we plan to develop the Corps into a platform for citizen engagement and volunteerism in healthcare during peacetime, and to serve as a reserve pool in times of crisis.
