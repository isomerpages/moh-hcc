Out of the 17,100 SG Healthcare Corps volunteers, 6,200 are healthcare professionals, including dentists, pharmacists and allied health professionals, the ministry told The Straits Times.

Dr Ng Chin Siau, chief executive officer and founder of Q&M Dental, said: "As dentists, we're very well-trained in infection control, and we have good hygiene standards in addition to our personal protection equipment, so we should give back to Singapore because we have the ability and means to do so."

Dr Mohan Rajah, an orthodontist, said: "Besides teaching one another to conduct the nasal swabs correctly, practising on each other enables us to better understand what the patient goes through each time, so we know how to minimise their discomfort."
