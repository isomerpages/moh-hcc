Some have been deployed into support care roles, where their nursing background is put to good use in a range of basic clinical tasks, and assisting patients with activities of daily living. Others have received just-in-time training and taken up more specialised roles in vaccination and swab testing operations.

Anyone can play a part during this period, both healthcare professionals and laypeople. We thank all who have stepped forward. Their contributions and expertise have been an invaluable help.
