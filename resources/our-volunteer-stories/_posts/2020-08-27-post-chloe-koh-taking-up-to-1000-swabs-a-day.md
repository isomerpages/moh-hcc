Chloe was part of the SG Healthcare Corps in fighting COVID-19.

Chloe volunteered with the Health Promotion Board from June to August 2020 as a Swabbing Assistant at Community Recovery facilities.

During this time, she supported COVID-19 efforts by taking biological samples from foreign workers in dormitories and other quarantine facilities in Singapore. She also provided administrative support, including conducting triage and checking clients’ well-being.

Chloe says, “I was glad that my work made a difference in helping to detect cases early and to prevent new clusters from this early detection.”
