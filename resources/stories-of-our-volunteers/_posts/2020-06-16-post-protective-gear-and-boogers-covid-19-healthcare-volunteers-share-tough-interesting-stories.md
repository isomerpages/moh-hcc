Lee, the founder of content marketing agency Lede Collective, took Yahoo News Singapore through her training at Nanyang Polytechnic, which included practising to take a swab sample from the life-sized head of a mannequin.

While the training session had its light-hearted moments, other aspects of volunteering have placed volunteers under challenging circumstances.

One volunteer who helps take care of affected migrant workers is 32-year-old Joy Tan Xiang Zhou, a cruise ship nurse who had to stop work since the virus hit. She chose not to stay at home.

A fellow nurse who immediately responded to the call for help was Herbert Phoon Yew Chong, a retiree who now trains other volunteers in putting on their PPE. The 66-year-old’s nursing career spans more than 40 years, including through the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) period in 2003.

Another volunteer who stressed that transmission could be “close to nil” with the right precautions was Dr Terry Teo, a dentist who swabbed migrant workers in dormitories in April.
