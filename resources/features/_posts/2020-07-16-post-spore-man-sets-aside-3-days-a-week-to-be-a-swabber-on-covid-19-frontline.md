Fong saw that the call for volunteers, previously restricted to those with a healthcare background, was being opened up to those from “all walks of life”.

As a swabber, Fong has the closest contact with the “clients” – those who are part of the targeted groups identified as part of the national testing strategy for Covid-19.

Fong also reflects on how he and his fellow swabbers share “a sense of togetherness”. While they come from different backgrounds, they have “respect and appreciation for each other’s diversities”, he says.

The experience of being a volunteer swabber has made Fong reflect on the importance of the Singapore Together movement, which supports passionate Singaporeans who are helping others in the community who have been affected by Covid-19.

“I think Singapore Together is really important, both for our life-stage as a country, and especially so in the time of Covid-19”, Fong says.

Fong leaves us with some words of encouragement, which he hopes might convince some of those who are on the fence about stepping up to volunteer in some capacity.
